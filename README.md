About the "Infinite Continue" patches:  
I'm not exactly a fan of continue limits so just for some more experience I looked at how to remove these limits.  
About the "Music Speed Hack" patch:  
Even though the PAL version of megaman 2 had its pitch adjusted, it still has awfully slow music playback speed.  
This patch will make its music play MUCH closer to the original, both intro and ending also had its speed adjusted to match the faster music better.  
If you happen to have any game you want to see patched just open up a issue with your request, I like looking at different games ;)
