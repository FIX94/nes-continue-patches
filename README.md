About the "Infinite Continue" patches:  
I'm not exactly a fan of continue limits so just for some more experience I looked at how to remove these limits.    

About the "PAL Music Pitch Hack" patch:  
Batman had its speed adjusted to PAL, but the music pitch remained unchanged, leading to its notes being too low compared to the NTSC original.  
This patch adjusts the pitch of all notes to be much closer to the NTSC original version.    

About the "PAL Music Speed Hack" patches:  
Even though the PAL versions of megaman 1 and megaman 2 had its pitch adjusted, it still has awfully slow music playback speed.  
This patch will make its music play MUCH closer to the NTSC speed, both intro (in megaman 2) and ending (in megaman 1 and 2) visuals also had its speed adjusted to match the now faster music playback better. Also the broken sound effects of both megaman 1 and 2 have now been fixed and play back very close to the original NTSC releases.  
Megaman 6 never had a PAL release, so apply this patch to the US version of the game, it patches the music to play at PAL speed and fix its pitch, as well as adjust intro and ending visuals for this new speed.  
The patch for PAL castlevania does adjust both pitch and speed, because that title did not have either adjusted. The same goes for contra, note that its patch applies to the US version of the game, and makes the music run at proper speed when running on PAL.    

About the "Music Only" patches:  
The patch for journey to silius will make the game boot directly into a menu from which you can listen to any track in the game, sort of like a nsf music file, just in ROM form.  
Batman did not have such a menu so this is just a simple hack that starts playing the first track with a black screen and allows you to press start to move to the next track.  
Gremlins 2 - The New Batch works exactly like batmans music only patch, just a black screen and you being able to press start to go to the next track.  
Super Spy Hunter also did not have a menu so for that you press start on the title, it will play the first track, from there you can press start to move to the next track just like in batman.  

About the "Complete Music Sampler" patch:  
Gimmicks sound test is accessed by pressing select+start on the title screen, it is missing the track "Evidence of My Life" and an alternative version of the track "Cadbury", this patch adds both of these tracks to it.  
It also makes the cursor color change far more often to the music than it did in the original music sampler to make it a bit more visually interesting.    

About the "Complete Sound Test" patch:  
Batmans sound test is accessed by pressing a+start on the title screen, it is missing 2 music tracks and 15 sound effects in total, this patch makes all of them accessable.  
Also the original select system went from A-Z, now instead it goes by numbers, so in the music case, 01-15 and in the sound effect case 01-41.    

About the "Everdrive N8" fix:  
The game will boot up seemingly fine but there will be minor graphical glitches with the current EverDrive OS (v16) because of a misinterpreted register write, this patch will remove that write to not cause that issue anymore.    

How to apply these patches:  
Click on the patch you want and click the "Download" button in the right of the page that opens.  
These .ips patches can then be applied with a program such as Lunar IPS, in it simply select the .ips patch and the original ROM file you want it to be applied to, this will modify that ROM with the selected .ips patch.    

If you happen to have any game you want to see patched just open up a issue with your request, I like looking at different games ;)
