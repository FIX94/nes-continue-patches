About the "Infinite Continue" patches:  
I'm not exactly a fan of continue limits so just for some more experience I looked at how to remove these limits.  
About the "Music Speed Hack" patch:  
Even though the PAL version of megaman 2 had its pitch adjusted, it still has awfully slow music playback speed.  
This patch will make its music play MUCH closer to the NTSC speed, both intro and ending visuals also had its speed adjusted to match the now faster music playback better.  
About the "Music Only" patch:
This patch will make the game boot directly into a menu from which you can listen to any track in the game, sort of like a nsf music file, just in ROM form.  
How to apply these patches:  
Click on the patch you want and click the "Download" button in the right of the page that opens.  
This .ips patch can then be used with a program such as Lunar IPS, in it simply select the .ips patch and the original ROM file you want it to be applied to, this will modify that ROM with the selected .ips patch.  
If you happen to have any game you want to see patched just open up a issue with your request, I like looking at different games ;)
